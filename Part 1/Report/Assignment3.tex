\chapter{Assignment 3}
The first problem is solvable with yices. This can be expressed as an SMT problem with linear integer equations.  In these linear equations $S_i$ refers to the start of job $i$ with length $i$.

To express this problem in an SMT problem, 2 general predicate are defined. The first predicate makes sure that job $a$ is after job $b$. This can be expressed as follows: $S_{a} \ge S_{b} + b$. This predicate is called $precedence(a, b)$. The second predicate is that 2 jobs, namely $a$ and $b$, do not overlap. This is called $dont\_overlap(a, b)$ and can be expressed as follows:
\begin{align*}
&\neg (S_a \ge S_b \land S_a < S_b + b) \\
\land &\neg (S_a + a > S_b \land S_a + a \le S_b + b) \\
\land &\neg (S_b \ge S_a \land S_b < S_a + a) \\
\land &\neg (S_b + b > S_a \land S_b + b \le S_a + a) 
\end{align*}

Then the resulting problem becomes quite easy. We assume there is a list $P$ with all the precedences. Also a list $C$ with all the jobs that can not run concurrently.

\begin{align*}
\forall_{<a,b> \in P}& \; precedence(a, b) \\
\forall_{<a,b> \in C}& \; dont\_overlap(a, b) \\
\forall_{1 \le i \le 12}& \; S_i \ge 0
\end{align*}

The total resulting span of the jobs is 36. The resulting plan is plotted in \ref{fig:assignments3}.
